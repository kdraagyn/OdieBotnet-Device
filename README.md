# OdieBotnet-Device

This Library is meant to allow for easy access to OdieBotnet device services. Odiebotnet manages an automatically configurable home automation service that new devices should use in order to be controlled and be used in the OdieBotnet ecosystem.

In order to connect to a router a file called "OdieBotnetEnvironment.h" must be written that includes definitions for WIFI\_SSID and WIFI\_PASSWORD.
